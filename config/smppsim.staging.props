# Byte Stream Callback
#
# This feature, if enabled, will cause SMPPSim to send PDUs received from the ESME or sent to it 
# as byte streams over a couple of connections.
# This is intended to be useful in automated testing scenarios where you need to notify the test application
# with details of what was *actually* received by SMPPSim (or sent by it).
#
# Note that byte streams are prepended by the following fields:
#
# a 4 byte integer which indicates the length of the whole callback message
# a 1 byte indicator of the type of interaction giving rise to the callback, 
# - where 0x01 means SMPPSim received a request PDU and 
#         0x02 means SMPPSim sent a request PDU (e.g. a DeliverSM)
# a 4 byte fixed length identified, which identifies the SMPPSim instance that sent the bytes
#
# So the length of the SMPP pdu is the callback message length - 9.
#
# LENGTH(4) TYPE(1) ID(4) PDU (LENGTH)
